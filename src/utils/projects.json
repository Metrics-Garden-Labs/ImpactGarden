It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n","bio":"Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community.

This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they’d like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions.

Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‘recycling’, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully.

It transforms passive listeners into co-creators. \n\n“Music isn't just about sound; it's about the memories and emotions they evoke. ‘Scenes’ is an effort to give a tangible form to this abstract connection and capture it in something we can recognise,” shares Reddington. “Each song and its accompanying ‘Scenes’ will populate a digital gallery – an archive that's a living testament to how music interacts with life moments in today's social media-dominated era.\"\n\nOver 300 listeners have contributed Scenes, embarking upon what fans are calling a “journey through the rich tapestry of our inner worlds.” The BBC Radio-featured artist and web3 pioneer chooses one Scene to be each track’s primary artwork, and then all the personal moment submitted are encapsulated onchain as a digital collectables that forever links artist and listener. Scenes reaches into real world audiences and makes an emotional connection and invites them to consider what owning this digital artefact of the moment means to them (a function that only the blockchain can offer\n). The project will be displayed as an interactive physical exhibition at the Future of Music Conference and other music festivals, offering an example of how to rethink creative releases and allowing people to collect the Scenes that resonate with them in IRL as the project goes on a physical tour.\n\nScenes comprises of 6 interactive rounds where the singles are presented to the audiences pre release so that when the song and its respective gallery goes love they have already formed an emoitnal bond and contributed. For each scene of the 6 scenes a limited music NFT (the song and Gif of all submissions) is released via Manifold and a the gallery collection goes live as a Zora collection displaying and recording all audience member submissions as individual pieces of artwork. This allow for different collector profiles to connect with the project: Those who want a limited song, those who want to own their Scene and those who discover Scene that resonates with them and want to collect it.\n\n“Scenes” is Reddington’s most salient experiment to date. It builds upon a reputation based as much on championing music communities as his unique sonic signature, which blends elements of Jamie XX and Burial with found sounds like his daughter’s heartbeat.\n\nScenes aims to re-imagine the music album as an ongoing collaborative piece of performance art that explores the relationship between memories, music and our online selves to form an archive onchain of each contributors encapsulated experience.  \n\nMore about Sound of Fractures:\nJamie’s previous success, with tracks like the euphoric 'Real Friends’' and club-heavy 'Let Go, have showcased his distinctive synthesis of films, stories, and human emotions in his music. Sound of Fractures takes elements of Jamie XX and Burial and mixes it with found sounds, like his daughter’s heartbeat and day to day life to create a unique form of deeply emotional electronic music. This time, with \"Scenes\", he goes a step further, seeking to challenge the traditional album format. Instead of offering passive consumption, he sparks an active dialogue with listeners by intertwining personal stories and music. Through this new project listeners are not just passive consumers but active collaborators.  The concept of world-building is central to Jamie's vision. In an era where music has become commodified, and artist identities often diluted, Sound of Fractures offers an alternative. “World Building is forging these connections that create strong emotional bonds around an artist's music. In today's digital life, music isn't just a product; it's an entire world that fans should desire to engage with, to be part of,\" Jamie articulates.\nWith the fusion of web2 and web3, as previously seen in his 'IRL' EP, Jamie is no stranger to the frontier of the digital and physical crossovers. His exploration of how to re-think music releases has not only positioned him as a pioneer but has also showcased the potential of new technology in building artist-audience relationships without big tech gatekeepers. As Jamie succinctly puts it, \"Web3 isn't an 'or'; it's an 'and, a tool’'. A new dimension of creative freedom. It's about breaking the mold, starting new conversations, and forging genuine relationships with our fans. The future for independent artists is uncertain, but we can keep experimenting and find new approaches that bring more value to both musicians and fans\". While building a strong community across his socials by challenging the current narratives of music careers, the Scenes project offers creators a real world example of how things can be done differently. \n","bio":"Rising UK-based electronic artist and producer Jamie Reddington (aka Sound of Fractures) announces his groundbreaking project, \"Scenes.” The interactive album invites fans to contribute their favourite memories and photographs in response to each of the record’s songs, encouraging a lean-in, emotional connection that’s been lost in our passive streaming environment.

When I began exploring blockchain technology for my art, my goal was to create a more immersive experience for my fans. I wanted to forge a deeper connection with my audience beyond traditional means, leading to the creation of the Soundverse. This journey began in 2021 with Rap Pack NFTs, where I offered streaming royalties in exchange for holding my music NFTs. While this was a fruitful start, I aimed to dive deeper than merely sharing streaming royalties.\n\nI envisioned a storybook world governed entirely by sound, which led to the development of multiple Music NFT PFP collectibles. These offered rewards such as custom songs, chapter features within the Soundverse story, and various interactive opportunities. As I expanded this world, I focused on building the lore around my original holders and engaged new fans.\n\nI released singles as open editions on Ethereum and Polygon. Discovering Sound XYZ allowed me to launch songs on the Optimism (OP) chain. Throughout 2022, I distributed NFTs through email signups and other messaging methods, onboarding new and existing investors to OP. Influencers from East Asia supported my releases due to the low entry price, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their financial situation, could hold my music. This inclusive approach was well-received by my community.\n\nWorking with P00ls, I developed Sound Coin, which now has 13,000 holders across various L2 chains. My broader vision involves transitioning these Polygon holders to the OP chain with Sound Gold ($SGLD), the main currency for exclusive and immersive experiences. Both tokens offer redeemable content and services, with significant potential for interactivity.\n\nOn the BASE network, I released Based Sound ($BSOUND), an active liquidity and educational token. Buying $BSOUND grants a music meme NFT on BASE, with staking options to earn music NFTs from my Based Music collection. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that connects me with my fans in an intimate way.\n\nAdditionally, I am developing a simple game initially available to beta testers (my top holders) before a wider release on web2 and web3. The game, featuring crypto, music, and popular trends, will integrate blockchain technology, allowing players to earn Sound Coin and Sound Gold based on their performance. This game will strengthen my ecosystem and benefit the blockchain as a whole.\n\nBenefits of the Soundverse Ecosystem:\n\n\t1.\tSound Gold:\n\t•\tAttracts my existing community and new users interested in music-related utility products on the OP chain.\n\t•\tFosters consistent interactions and utility through my frequent music and content releases.\n\t•\tAttracts high-level investors to the OP chain once the proof of concept is established.\n\t2.\tWeb3 Integrated Game:\n\t•\tAppeals to music fans, gamers, and P2E crypto users, exposing more ETH-based users to the OP chain.\n\t•\tGenerates cash flow through in-game ads, with a portion used to add liquidity to Sound Gold and Sound Coin.\n\t•\tFeatures my music catalog during gameplay, enhancing my brand.\n\t•\tReleases a Music NFT PFP collection on OP, with traits that provide gameplay rewards.\n\t3.\tSound Coin (Polygon):\n\t•\tFacilitates the onboarding of Polygon holders to OP, leveraging over 300,000 interactions and weekly earnings.\n\nThe Sound Ecos is continuously evolving. I am proud of the progress and believe the Soundverse Ecosystem can serve as a blueprint for other artists seeking to build their identity and foster greater interactions. If awarded a grant, I would use the funds for further development, initial liquidity for Sound Gold, and additional marketing, promotion, and mint rewards.\n\nI aim to keep the game and coin integration simple, providing a low-risk environment for users to enjoy the blockchain while engaging with my music. Consistent releases on OP/BASE/ZORA and other L2s will remain a cornerstone of my growing ecosystem.","bio":"What is Sound Ecos?\n\nMy name is Malik Naim, I am a creative who's most passionate mediums are sound and pen.

The metadata and art for all of these collections is stored fully onchain and each collection is composable onchain, meaning the art for each NFT can be included in another onchain collection simply by referencing the NFT's smart contract.\n\nThe first collection was a limited supply collection representing the first fully onchain interactive version of Steamboat Willie, titled Onchain Steamboat Willie. With Onchain Steamboat Willies, the art is composable, which means other onchain NFT collections could use the Steamboat Willie art in their art simply by referencing the Onchain Steamboat Willie smart contracts.

Each Pop Willie is created from multiple Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs. By minting a Pop Willie NFT, you'd also receive the 4 (or 9) Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs that make up your Pop Willie's art. Furthermore, at any point, if you collect a new Onchain Steamboat Willie, you could add that Steamboat Willie your Pop Willie NFT's art by simply calling the \"paintWillies4\" function on the Pop Willies smart contract, allowing you to forever modify your NFT's art through onchain art composability. Pop Willies minted out with a supply of 300.\n\nThe third collection is Based Moon, which was an open edition dropped on both X and (via open-source frame) on Farcaster.

LogX pioneered and launched our own native perps on L2s like Mode Network with an innovative “Discrete Asset, Market Neutral” (DAMN) AMM pools. These pools take in stable assets like USDT, USDC, wUSDM, etc. and enable oracle-based perp trading to traders.\n- Backed by reputed investors like Sequoia Capital (India), Coinbase Ventures, IOSG, Hashed and more!\n- Crossed $15B in trading volume with more than 155k wallets in 9 months of operation.\n\nSince our inception, LogX’s mission has been to make the experience of trading on-chain bigger and better than CeFi, and through that onboard CEX users to DEXes. In fact this mission has remained unaltered ever since we wrote about it in our introduction blog in 2023 here: https://flintlabs.medium.com/flint-labs-next-chapter-7e56a87f4f5e\n\nIn our 9 months of operation, we have boldly explored various offerings for different trader segments. We identified two primary trader segments: pro traders desiring orderbook functionality and tools, and those seeking a simpler UX for multi-chain exploration. So we built LogX Pro for the former and LogX OG for the latter.\n\nLogX Pro is an Orderbook based Perp Dex which is live on Optimism Main-net, Arbitrum  and Base Network.\n\nLogX OG is a Perp DEX which is based on our own AMM pools.\n\n**Our Competitive Edge and Uniqueness:**\n\n- Low-Cost, High Liquidity Offering: LogX offers unmatched cost efficiency and high liquidity across multiple trading pairs, setting a new benchmark in the decentralized trading space.\n- Technological Superiority: Our innovative DAMN based AMM pool enables us to launch a perpetual dex on newer networks and ecosystems like Mode network at a speed unheard of. We were the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network and bootstrapped liquidity to more than $3M in TVL and $1.3B in trading volume\n\n**Growth**\n\nLogX has been one of the fastest growing Perp DEXes on layer 2 networks. We were also the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network in the first week of Main-net launch and are still the largest perp dex on Mode Network. We were the preferred strategic launch partner for Mode Network. \n\nSharing some metrics for LogX’s performance on the Mode Network.\n\n- TVL: $3M\n- Unique wallet addresses (lifetime): 30,000\n- Total trading volume lifetime(March-May): $1.3B\n- Avg DAU(last 30 days): 250\n\nLogX is also deployed on Optimism Main-net through their LogX Pro product which is an Orderbook based Perp Dex powered by the Orderly Network and has crossed $12B in trading volume with more than 30,000 wallets on the Optimism and Arbitrum Network combined.\n\nLogX’s overall performance across all the deployed L2s can be found here: https://app.logx.trade/dashboard\n\nThe whole premise of LogX is based built upon composability. LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.\n\nThis is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props.","bio":"What is LogX?\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- LogX is like 1inch for perps - helping on-chain traders find the best execution for their perp trades\n- LogX is also the leading Perp DEX on layer 2 networks including Mode Network and Optimism Main-Net.

These pools take in stable assets like USDT, USDC, wUSDM, etc. and enable oracle-based perp trading to traders.\n- Backed by reputed investors like Sequoia Capital (India), Coinbase Ventures, IOSG, Hashed and more!\n- Crossed $15B in trading volume with more than 155k wallets in 9 months of operation.\n\nSince our inception, LogX’s mission has been to make the experience of trading on-chain bigger and better than CeFi, and through that onboard CEX users to DEXes. In fact this mission has remained unaltered ever since we wrote about it in our introduction blog in 2023 here: https://flintlabs.medium.com/flint-labs-next-chapter-7e56a87f4f5e\n\nIn our 9 months of operation, we have boldly explored various offerings for different trader segments. We identified two primary trader segments: pro traders desiring orderbook functionality and tools, and those seeking a simpler UX for multi-chain exploration. So we built LogX Pro for the former and LogX OG for the latter.\n\nLogX Pro is an Orderbook based Perp Dex which is live on Optimism Main-net, Arbitrum  and Base Network.\n\nLogX OG is a Perp DEX which is based on our own AMM pools.\n\n**Our Competitive Edge and Uniqueness:**\n\n- Low-Cost, High Liquidity Offering: LogX offers unmatched cost efficiency and high liquidity across multiple trading pairs, setting a new benchmark in the decentralized trading space.\n- Technological Superiority: Our innovative DAMN based AMM pool enables us to launch a perpetual dex on newer networks and ecosystems like Mode network at a speed unheard of. We were the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network and bootstrapped liquidity to more than $3M in TVL and $1.3B in trading volume\n\n**Growth**\n\nLogX has been one of the fastest growing Perp DEXes on layer 2 networks. We were also the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network in the first week of Main-net launch and are still the largest perp dex on Mode Network. We were the preferred strategic launch partner for Mode Network. \n\nSharing some metrics for LogX’s performance on the Mode Network.\n\n- TVL: $3M\n- Unique wallet addresses (lifetime): 30,000\n- Total trading volume lifetime(March-May): $1.3B\n- Avg DAU(last 30 days): 250\n\nLogX is also deployed on Optimism Main-net through their LogX Pro product which is an Orderbook based Perp Dex powered by the Orderly Network and has crossed $12B in trading volume with more than 30,000 wallets on the Optimism and Arbitrum Network combined.\n\nLogX’s overall performance across all the deployed L2s can be found here: https://app.logx.trade/dashboard\n\nThe whole premise of LogX is based built upon composability. LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.\n\nThis is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props.","address":"0x08e584","bannerImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f01b04ff-5b70-4465-8ca6-0a2183eacdfe.png","profileImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/b8d11828-ef43-4b8c-ad0e-44a3f04d8ad5.png","impactCategory":["DeFi"],"primaryCategory":"DeFi","recategorization":"DeFi","prelimResult":"Keep","reportReason":"","includedInBallots":0},{"id":"0xfb05b0a958f63797c084d6038c99506c3da915f314911155c650517366748628","name":"MagicalTux","displayName":"MagicalTux","description":"MagicalTux was created to bring new users to the Optimism chain via community gathering, fun, and excitement. \nI myself ran to MagicalTux as the culture of the crypto industry chose memes to rule onchain transaction.

This capital formation mechanism can be combined with some of the existing resource allocation mechanisms (e.g., QF, RetroPGF, etc.)\n\nTo validate the idea and test our contracts, we launched a viral campaign during the initial frames “hype” on farcaster. We developed POWERBALD, a free-to-play lottery in a frame where people could claim free tickets and try their luck in the daily drawing. We gave away multiple millions of $DEGEN as jackpot prizes and grew a [community of over 27,000 lottery](https://warpcast.com/lottopgf) enthusiasts. \nWith our PowerBALD lotteries, we raised $1,500 to co-sponsor a Giveth QF round and are currently integrating with [Zuzalu.city](http://zuzalu.city/) to raise funds for their initiatives.\n\nThe PowerBALD Lottery contract was deployed at `0xc94e65A6d6C145B6A0342dA9b5e8Dc3928505857` through our `LooteryFactory` at `0xdED85d9e814c4C23D2632511d3Be9aC4e49524b0`.

Our Buildathons, including collaborations like frENS, are key to empowering individuals to develop innovative decentralised digital identities.\n\nBuildathon 1: We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites\nBuildathon 2: Done in collaboration with frENS. We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites.\nBuildathon 3: Still in progress we a giving $1200 to five winners\n\n\nKey features of Webhash: \n\nNo-Code Interface: We've created a no-code, user-friendly interface that makes building decentralised websites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.\nVersatile Content Creation & Integration: Our platform at Webhash enriches the ENS domain experience by enabling users to create a broad spectrum of content types with seamless integrations. We have designed a user-friendly interface that allows for the addition of various standard elements such as avatars with diverse styles, engaging headings, informative paragraphs, and external links, all of which enhance the user's webpage. The integration capabilities of our platform include a suite of options that cater to different media types and functionalities:\n\nSocial Media Integration: Users can showcase their social presence with icons linked to their profiles on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and more, fostering engagement directly from their ENS dwebsite.\n\nMultimedia Content: Embedding capabilities for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Spotify, and SoundCloud allow users to share a wide range of audiovisual content, from music tracks and podcasts to videos and livestreams.\n\nWeb3 activity blocks: Integrated key web3 projects like Farcaster and POAP so that users can showcase their web3 activity. \n\nInteractive Features: Inclusion of interactive elements such as image sliders, RSS feeds, countdown widgets, and forms elevates the user experience by engaging visitors with dynamic content.\nContent Distribution: Our platform supports file sharing directly from the page, whether it’s audio files, PDF documents, or any downloadable content, making it a versatile tool for content distribution.\nCommunication and Sharing: Integration of communication tools like Discord servers and call-to-action prompts encourages community building and interaction. Additionally, our VCard feature enables users to share contact information in a professional manner.\n\nMonetization: We've integrated payment solutions like PayPal, enabling users to collect payments for products, services, or donations directly through their ENS decentralised website.\n\nCustomization: Advanced customization with custom HTML/CSS/JS and Markdown formatting allows for unique content creation. \n\nCredibility and Engagement: By adding customer reviews and FAQs, users can build credibility and provide valuable information to their audience.\n\nThe combination of these features on the Webhash platform not only empowers users to create comprehensive 'link-in-bio' pages but also extends to more complex decentralised website formats such as blogs, portfolios, and business landing pages. Each feature is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that even those with no coding skills can build a professional and aesthetically pleasing online presence on the decentralised web.\n\nSeamless ENS and DNS Domain Connections: We've streamlined the process of connecting ENS and traditional DNS domains to decentralised websites, making it hassle-free and efficient.\nCollaboration with ETH.limo: We've partnered with ETH.limo to ensure optimal speed and availability for the decentralised websites hosted on our platform.\n\nMonetization Through NFTs: We've innovated in monetization by allowing users to mint their website designs as NFTs, creating new economic opportunities within the ENS ecosystem.\nArweave Integration: Our integration with Arweave enables a persistent web presence, ensuring durability and longevity of the content.\n\nSetting Resolvers for Domains: We've simplified the process of setting resolvers for ENS domains, addressing a common challenge faced by users.\n\nSubdomain and Wrapped Domain Support: We've Introduced support for both subdomains and wrapped domains. This feature lets users build and manage a network of decentralised websites under one ENS domain. Whether it’s for different projects, services, or varied content types, our users can now efficiently organise their online presence.\n","address":"0x41ca","bannerImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/c2a0274d-cbd6-41d6-9b0a-395791c7fc01.png","profileImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/608a9de7-0ce2-463f-bb0a-ff4933dc4b5c.png","impactCategory":["Social"],"primaryCategory":"Social","recategorization":"Social","prelimResult":"Keep","reportReason":"","includedInBallots":0},{"id":"0x3e99f9f989d2d18cf6fe10a7bbf087c97401d666209fc00480063d1086e1e66d","name":"Omni X","displayName":"Omni X","description":"Omni X is an omnichain NFT launchpad built on LayerZero.

The deployed Smart Accounts are non-custodially managed by the Farcaster user accounts.\n\nThe DappyKit SDK contains a set of tools designed for managing finances and data in the Superchain. Additionally, to enhance engagement in Optimism and Farcaster-based projects, we have developed a platform for nano-applications based on DappyKit.\n\nWith our SDK, developers can build Superchain Nano Apps for Farcaster, increasing the activity of all Superchain networks. To ensure developer engagement, we are currently conducting an online hackathon for creating Nano applications.\n\nThe deployed Smart Accounts can be seen here: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00004ec70002a32400f8ae005a26081065620d20\nThe issued verification tokens for Farcaster accounts were released here: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x02e4227ed20379db2999511609b8e2b28f73f0e0\nFarcaster post with Frame deploying the Smart Account of a Farcaster user: https://warpcast.com/dappykit/0x6bf4f0b4\nAnnouncement of the nano-app authorization system release on Farcaster with DappyKit technologies: https://warpcast.com/dappykit/0x9bcfba07\nHackathon announcement: https://warpcast.com/dappykit/0x0edb9d38","bio":"DappyKit - SocialFi project uniting various social platforms to avoid deplatforming.
